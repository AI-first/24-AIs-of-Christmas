# People

Everyone is welcome. Clear your agenda, leave your email client at home and dive in!

Not sure you are a AI wizzard? Doesn't matter you might have a problem people want
to work on.

More of a UI person? The smartest bit of machine-learning is useless if the interface
sucks! So come along.

# Format

Low key. Learn something new, so don't bring your pre-built prototype.

We start with collecting ideas that could profit from a AI solution. Then split into
small teams and get working. At the end of the day live demos only, no slideware.

# Data, data, data

No learning without data. Collect links to datasets in [#3](https://github.com/AI-first/24-AIs-of-Christmas/issues/3)
